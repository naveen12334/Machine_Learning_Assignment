    "Ans->sequential forward selection:---  Against a defined metric, first feature is chosen after a model is trained and produces the metric. Next feature is selected by searching for that feature which when clubbed with the first chosen feature gives best performance metric results via model training. More and more features are selected one by one while measuring the contribution of the clubbed features in each iteration against the metric using model trained on clubbed features till the required number of features are selected.\n",

    "Sequential backward exclusion:---  A model is trained on all features and the metric score is calculated. In each iteration, a feature is found which if removed from the collection of features, improves the metric score.
